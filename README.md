# About

This is a website created to phish the professor in the course IIK3100, Ethical hacking. Please do not fall for the trap, and do not enter your credentials.

I did not create the website, I simply copied the HTML and CSS of the LinkedIn login page, and added some JavaScript to send the credentials in an email to myself.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser
